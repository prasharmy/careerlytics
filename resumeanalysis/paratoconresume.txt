Scoring Methodology 



use this scoreing methodology


🧠 1️⃣ Quiz Score (What the user can actually do)

The quiz score is not just marks.
It is a skill signal.

It is calculated using your 30–30–40 model:

Layer	Weight	What it tells
General Ability	30%	How fast you can learn
Tech Fundamentals	30%	How strong your core CS is
Role Skills	40%	How job-ready you are

So:

Quiz Score =
(General × 0.30) +
(Tech × 0.30) +
(Role × 0.40)


Example:

General = 80%
Tech = 60%
Role = 50%

Quiz Score = 24 + 18 + 20 = 62%


This means:

The user is 62% ready to work in this role today

🧬 2️⃣ Resume Match Score (What the user claims)

This comes from your resume AI.

It checks:

Skills listed

Tools used

Projects

Years of exposure

For each role it outputs:

Resume Match %


Example:

Frontend → 75%
Backend → 45%
Full Stack → 60%


This means:

According to resume, user looks most like a Frontend dev.

But resumes lie — so we combine with quiz.

🎯 3️⃣ Role Likeliness Score (Final Truth)

This is what you show on dashboard.

Formula:

Role Likeliness =
(Resume Match × 0.40) + (Quiz Score × 0.60)


Because:

Resume shows exposure

Quiz shows ability

Example (Frontend):

Resume = 75%
Quiz = 62%

Role Likelihood = (75×0.4) + (62×0.6)
= 30 + 37.2
= 67.2%


This means:

User has 67% probability of succeeding as a Frontend developer

🧠 4️⃣ Risk Level

Based on Role Likelihood:

Likelihood	Meaning
75–100	Low Risk – job ready
55–75	Medium Risk – trainable
<55	High Risk – career mismatch

So 67% = Medium Risk

🧭 5️⃣ Recommended Roles

You calculate this for every role, even if user selected only one.

Example:

Role	Resume	Quiz	Final
Frontend	75%	62%	67% ⭐
Backend	40%	50%	46%
Full Stack	60%	58%	59%
Data Analyst	30%	45%	39%

You show:

Best fit: Frontend (67%)
Also good: Full Stack (59%)
