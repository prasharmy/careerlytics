Personalized Plan System Implementation
Create a comprehensive personalized learning plan system that generates 3-4 week skill development plans based on mock test performance, with daily tasks, weekly tests, and adaptive progression.

Overview
Implement a personalized plan system where users take initial assessment tests, receive AI-generated 3-4 week learning plans, complete daily tasks, pass weekly tests, and receive career readiness recommendations with adaptive difficulty adjustments.

Key Components
1. Personalized Plan Button & Initial Assessment
Add "Personalized Plan" button to UserHome dashboard
Create role/language selection interface
Implement comprehensive assessment test covering:
Topic accuracy analysis
Speed and consistency metrics
Weak area identification
Store assessment results for plan generation
2. AI Plan Generation System
Create models for storing personalized plans
Implement algorithm to generate 3-4 week plans based on assessment
Each week contains one skill block with daily topic assignments
Entire plan displayed but blurred/locked until unlocked
Sequential unlocking: Complete current day → Unlock next day
XP rewards: Daily task (15 XP), Weekly test completion (300 XP)
Bonus XP: Streak XP (discipline), Recovery XP (motivation after failure), Speed XP (mastery), Consistency XP (honesty)
Level system: 100 XP per level, displayed at top
Users use external platforms for actual learning and practice
3. Weekly Progression System
Weekly tests with 30 questions at end of each week
Pass threshold: ≥70% unlocks next week
Fail threshold: Weak Topic Diagnosis → Add 2-4 extra days to focus on week's weak topics
Adaptive difficulty based on performance
4. Final Assessment & Career Decision
Final role readiness test with 60 questions after 4 weeks
Calculate overall readiness percentage
If final test score ≤70%: Create 2-week correction plan focusing on all week topics
After 2-week correction completion: Take comprehensive test on all topics
Career recommendations based on final performance:
≥80%: Job Ready
60-80%: Needs additional training
<60%: Not suitable for this role
Role switch recommendations for persistent failures
5. Plan Management Features
Only one active plan at a time
Pause functionality with progress saving
Resume paused plans
Switch between plans (not concurrent)
Progress persistence across sessions
6. Resume Upgrade Tracking
Track resume improvement before and after personalized plan completion
Compare resume scores by role and skill
Display improvement percentages to users
Show impact statements like "Your Frontend resume is now 31% stronger"
